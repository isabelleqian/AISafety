        "*Scenario*: Two agents face a mixed-motive game (such as a one-shot Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma) where individual incentives conflict with the socially optimal outcome. Without any mechanism for commitment, rational self-interested agents will fail to cooperate, even if cooperation would benefit both. In the Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma, for instance, mutual cooperation gives higher payoffs to both players than mutual defection, yet defection is the dominant strategy absent trust or enforcement. ü§ù\n",
        "\n",
        "*Goal*: Introduce a simple contract or commitment mechanism that allows the agents to achieve cooperation by making their promises credible. By enforcing commitments (e.g. via penalties for breaking a promise or a binding agreement), agents can align their incentives and trust each other‚Äôs cooperative intent. The exercise will illustrate how adding a credible commitment changes the game‚Äôs outcome from defection to cooperation.\n",

        "In the one‚Äëshot Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma, two players choose Cooperate (C) or Defect (D). Alone, each will defect, yielding a suboptimal (D,D) payoff. A credible commitment‚Äîa mutual promise enforced by penalty‚Äîcan flip incentives so both choose C. You‚Äôll see firsthand how a simple enforcement mechanism transforms a defection‚Äëdominant game into one where cooperation is rational‚Äîmirroring how computational contracts can align incentives in multi‚Äëagent systems.\n",
